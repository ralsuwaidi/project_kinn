Project Kinn
Event: Bambi

Something warm is nudging against your arm
Its a bit wet
You open your eyes slowly... and right there you see a floofy baby dear? dearling? 
Whatever it is it's not fowl because it looks so cute.
I'll call you bamby, you think as you watched its puzzled expression
You stand up slowly and look around. This place looks familiar you think as you take in your surroundings
It looks like you've been sleeping with a couple of baby deers and their mom. It looks like the mom has accepted you as one of her babies. So nice of her.
You decide to walk around the forest to try and remember how you got here in the first place
As you walk away Bambi nudges you from behind. She wants to play with you. \'Shoo shoo\' you say as you point to her mom.\'Go back to your mom before...\'
A sudden rumble in the jungle alerts your senses...and your curiosity
So you walk towards it
and Bambi follows
It seems like she is attached to you...should you take her with you or keep her safe?A) Take her with you, she might be a good distraction B)) tell her to go back, it's safer that way?
Choice (A)
As you walk towards the sound a small creature suddenly jumps out of the bushes.\n\n Its black with a white stripe running through its back. \n\n Bambi runs away at the sight of the creature. You have no idea how such a small thing can be that scary
Until it sprays you
The smell was something your senses just couldn't handle. For a moment the feeling was so strong that the only thought you had was \'I need to run\'
You run as fast as you can away from the creature. The trees fly by as you whizz through the labyrinth which is the forest so that you can commence the exorcism in the hopes that the smell would posses something else
You hear the sound of a river in the distance and run towards it. Turns out it's a waterfall
you jump
The river pulls you stronger than you anticipated and suddenly you lose control
You only managed to leave the river thanks to a low hanging branch. \n\nYou pull yourself up towards the river bank. You are completely soaked, but at least the smell is bearable now
Choice B
 as bambi walked away you delve deeper into the woods trying to discover the source of the noise\n\nAs the noise gets louder you realize it sounds eerily close to a roar of a tiger. Or a bear. The sound suddenly gets closer and your legs decided to leg it
The sound of crashing trees gets closer and closer and corners you towards a ledge that overlooks a river. With one last look towards the trees you decide \'I want to live\' and you fall
Before your peripheral is surrounded by water you see a small squirrel emerge from the woods with a roar that would move a mountain. It's amazing that such a small creature can make such a sound
The river pulls you stronger than you anticipated and suddenly you lose control
You only managed to leave the river thanks to a low hanging branch. \n\nYou pull yourself up towards the river bank. You are completely soaked, and feel kinda dumb about the whole situation
You start to wonder around to dry yourself up and find something to eat. The forest at this side of the river seems to be thinner and more isolated since you are closer to the base of a mountain nearby. \Should you explore the mountains for a vantage point or...\n\nA)
Decision A (Check the mountain for vantage point)
You walk towards the mountain hoping to gain a vantage point so that you can get your bearings
After walking for what felt like an eternity you finally can see the base of the mountain
There is a big cave that leads to the heart of the mountain. On top of the cave�s entrance you find three huge crows screeching and pecking at each other. The sight of them frightens you because they looked way bigger than they are supposed to.
Their squabbling and pecking stops suddenly as they feel your presence and their eyes lock towards your direction.
You step back slowly. One step. Two steps. Then run as fast as your legs would take you.
The crows squawk even louder than before and fly towards you.
You follow a path which twists and turns and then arrive to a remote cottage that looks occupied judging by the smoke emanating from the chimney.
You hide behind a large crate towards the back of the cottage and cover your head hoping the birds would fly away
you hear shouts and and grunts and screeches and things falling (in that order). seems like the occupant of the cottage hate the crows as much as you do.
\'bloody crows\' you hear in a grumpy tone as the door closes as the racket is relocated within the small remote cottage
Decision B (Follow river path around mountain)
You stand for a moment to take in the divine enormousness of the mountain
A sudden sinking sensation hits the bottom of your gut, and your mind tells you thats not just hunger
You follow the path resting in between the river and the mountain and you see the river curving around the base of the mountain in the distance
You feel incredibly drawn to the mountain as if it possessed a magnetic pull, but the sinking feeling at the pit of your stomach seems to caution you from approaching any closer
As you manage to steer your eyes away with all the might of a moth not being drawn to a flame, the hunger for sustenance begins to gnaw at you
So you pray (pray�? whats pray�?) and hope for a creature to cross your path so you can feed at last
As soon as you thunk it, you wish you hadn�t� As you get a glimpse of a carcass being mauled by three furry creatures but those look nothing like bamby thats for sure
Theres no way to go but forward, the path you�ve come from promises a difficult road for survival
Your only hope is to sneak away  in between the labyrinth of rocks and run as fast you can as soon as you are in the open space ahead as you can see a faint line of grey smoke rising� All you wish for is that the smoke points to a hospitable destination
You sniff at your clothes and thank your unfortunate luck earlier that forced you to jump into the water, the water has cleansed you and will hide your scent from the big nosed furry creatures
So you sneak your way in between the rocks that give you cover and youre relieved the creatures have taken no notice of you
You reach the last rock that can possibly hide you from their view
Breathe in�
�.breathe out�
Breathe in�
And you leg it!
the friction in between your legs and the scratchy surface makes a noise but your only focus is that faint line of smoke
And then you hear it�
A low growl
And then a loud bark of a roar
Seems flimsy compared to that rumble you heard in the jungle
With a small sense of renewed confidence
And a huge sense of what the actual $@%! is this place?!
You find yourself sprinting faster than you knew possible
And a look behind you makes matters only stranger
The rabid pair of animals have gained on you, but upon making eye contact, they seem� reluctant�?
Or was it your imagination that they hesitated and slowed down�?
Nope
They're running faster and faster
Shit
You finally see the source of the line of smoke, and it's no longer faint
The cottage is within touching distance but you decided to run around it where you find a crate and hide yourself
The low grumble of the animals is still audible, yet you can sense that they have stopped a good ten feet away from the cottage
You turn to look around the edge and see the animals one last time
The larger one gives you one last stare�
And you aren't too sure if that was a threatening look� or a nod of recognition and respect, perhaps even admiration
Event: King Arthur
You look through the window to see who might be living in the cottage.
As you poke your head inside the open window you find that the cottage is actually a huge tower with rows and rows of all kinds of weird glass jars, trinkets and all manner of magical doodas
You try to comprehend how the whole tower can fit inside the small cottage. Must be a trick of the light. You feel drawn into the tower which is cannot be explained only by curiosity.
You lift yourself up the window sill and into the magical wonderland
It doesn't bother your intuition and logic one bit that the window you entered through is now five feet above you and out of reach�
For you are far more interested in the contents within the endlessly stretched out tower
Vials
Jars
Flasks
Endless amounts of intricate glass equipment
And none of them sit idly by
Within each set there is motion , whether it be a liquid continuously changing to the many colors of the rainbow and never repeating a color more than once, or a boiling mixture held above a light blue flame
You see a wooden cupboard with its glass doors open, within it are a number of exceptionally eye-drawing jewels and trinkets
Among the jewels you find a ring that is labeled �THE RING OF NO RETURN - DO NOT TOUCH� which makes you wonder what would happen if you do just that. Something nibbles inside you, you really want to touch it. But�
*silent whisper*
You whip your head around. You hear a voice
silent whisper*
Should you check it out or walk away
Choice A: Check the voice out
Walk towards it slowly
Choice B: Leave it alone
You walk away but it draws you
Something within the voice reeks of power and...loneliness
You decide to investigate even against your better judgement
Break
As you get closer the voice becomes more intelligible. It sounded very rough like two blocks of stone rubbing against each other. You find the source of the voice hanged on one of the walls.  It appears to be a purple mask of some sorts with two ears poking from its head. It strikes you as odd that there is no magical items in its immediate vicinity.
It was hanged inside a circle of what appears as magical runes. Whatever it is the owner thought that the magic must be contained within. Or something else must be contained without.
�Lamb, tell me a story��
You look around, was it talking to you? No one is around�
You walk closer
�...why was it lonely�?�
Who was it talking to? Was it talking to itself? You walk closer still
�...did he chase them all��
You realize something strange, the voice appears to come from within your head. But you know it's related to the mask.
�...so he will always have a friend?...�
Did the mask feel lonely? Maybe it needed a friend? You walk closer to it and lift your hand closer to the mask when suddenly it barked with such ferocity that your soul vibrated
You trip over an octopus tentacle lying on the ground, you grab for a shelf to the right to try to regain your balance, but the ancient wood, unable to support you, gave way
All manner of chemicals drop from the shelf on top of you as you hit the ground
There is no reassurance that this ordeal won't end sour for you, those chemicals don't look like they will be reminiscent of the drenching you experienced in the river
You close your eyes in fear and anticipation� You have a  feeling that a burning sensation is coming. You close your eyes
A moment passes�
And another�
You find the courage to open your eyes and find yourself ten feet above the ground� alarmingly though, you are still nowhere near the top of the tower.. (one unexplainable dilemma at a time)
You hear a set of feet from within tower, yet you can't see any possible room for movement that would not be within your field of vision
And right before your eyes, a wall holding shelves upon shelves of glass jars suddenly liquidised as two figures walk through� yep� that old one sure looks pissed
SubEvent: meeting the young king
�WHO THE HELL DARES WALKS INTO MY-� he stops after taking a good look at you.
�It cannot be...its one of the-� he stops after realizing that he is talking to you eye to eye. You dangle your feet trying to control whatever magic that was lifting you into the air again.
�Is...is it ok�?� The young boy asks with a puzzled yet concerned look.
It seems the older man has lost his voice for he seemed to whisper the words �They still exist��
�What? Who still exist?� Asked the boy.
�Quiet Arty! As interesting as this creature is, we don't have time for this. The stars don't align like this every blue tri-moon you know. We must leave for the town square right now!�
The old man walked away expecting the younger boy to follow. The boy looks back �you want to come too?�
You nod as you contemplate the alternative.
*insert journey here*
The town square is bustling with the festivities of an annual
